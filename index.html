<p>Keyboard dynamics is a concept came and believed as an equivalent authentication hardening mechanism as biometrics. Its using the pattern analysis for security when people thought patterns can be unique. In fact, the concept was right to an extent. But by introducing the notion of AI and broadly implementing ML on this concept we would be able to achieve highly reliable security that might be stronger than biometrics.</p>

<p>This package is just a hard work of 1.5 month in which I have managed to incorporate the holding and releasing time of each key and create a huge comparison tree with that info in OOPS. I could also include the error prone matter of backspacing into it. I am sure if you try hard enough to find the patterns that make you stand out from others, you can have an awesome signature which you will generate and the script will compare always in your system without you knowing any complexities. You can add  this to your servers, home system, or office system or wherever you want which has a keyboard to type.
You can extent the feature of analyzing the mouse clicking and moving pattern and you can add your usual activity analysis and lot more, who is stopping you. Fork my git and give me 'pull' that's it right?!!</p>

<p>Will add later - after completion of the script. That's because I might change the base functionality again if I found a better one.</p>
