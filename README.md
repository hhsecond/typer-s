##Keyboard Dynamics - A better way to authenticate
typer-s (s for secure) is a software piece written in python which is implemented on top of AI through ML to make your environment secure. I believe every one who is belonging to homo-sapiens has a unique pattern. It was difficult to implement an algorithm to analyze this complex pattern earlier. But as the advancement of technology we could make our path easier to the success.

Keyboard dynamics is a concept came and believed as an equivalent authentication hardening mechanism as biometrics. Its using the pattern analysis for security when people thought patterns can be unique. In fact, the concept was right to an extent. But by introducing the notion of AI and broadly implementing ML up on it, we would be able to achieve highly reliable security that might be stronger than biometrics

It is basically workingon 3 trees that has the primitive data collected when user types. Then it will process and take data to first stage. Working on the post processings after the first stage. Script development is approaching the completion of first release. Still working on the cleanin up process in comparision algorithm. Once the current development completes i have to incorporate the backspacking pattern anaysis. Then will move to testing. 
Second release will consider the implementation of deep learning and neural networks.
